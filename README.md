# Dissertacao-Cristhiano_Henrique

This repository consists of the R code that was made to collect and concatenate and analyse economic data. [Cristhiano Henrique Eufrasio da Costa](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9252323905076913) hired me as a feelancer agent to build [this pannel data structure](https://github.com/vitorbborges/Dissertacao-Cristhiano_Henrique/blob/main/Parte%201/PAINEL_COMPLETO_formatado.xlsx) that will be used in his Master's Degree Thesis.

The main subject of his analysis is the impact of Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) Models of Administration in the economic wellbeing of the country in which it operates. FIU's can be run in one of the folowing models:

- The **Judicial Model** is when an FIU is established within the judicial branch of government. In this model “disclosures” of suspicious financial activity are received by a country’s investigative agencies from its financial sector so the judiciary powers can react (e.g., seizing funds, freezing accounts, conducting interrogations, detaining people, conducting searches, etc.).

- The **Law Enforcement Model** implements anti-money laundering measures alongside existing law enforcement systems, supporting the efforts of multiple law enforcement or judicial authorities with concurrent, or sometimes competing, jurisdictional authority to investigate money laundering.

- The **Administrative Model** is a centralized, independent, administrative authority, that receives and processes financial sector information and transmits disclosures to judicial or law enforcement authorities for prosecution. It functions as a “buffer” between the financial and law enforcement communities.

- The **Hybrid Model** serves as a disclosure intermediary and a link to both judicial and law enforcement authorities. It combines elements of at least two FIU models.

# Part 2: Teaching Stata and Econometric Analysis

In this part of the project, I guided Cristhiano through the process of using Stata, a powerful statistical software, and how to perform econometric analysis using this tool. This was essential for him to analyze the data I provided effectively.

## Stata Introduction

Stata is a complete, integrated statistical software package that provides everything you need for data analysis, data management, and graphics. It is widely used in academic research, especially in the social sciences, but also in fields as varied as economics, political science, and public health.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this part, Cristhiano was able to:

- Understand the Stata interface and its functionalities
- Import and manage datasets in Stata
- Perform basic statistical analyses
- Conduct econometric modeling and hypothesis testing
- Interpret the results of these analyses

## Econometric Analysis

Econometric analysis involves using statistical methods to estimate economic models. This can involve a wide range of techniques, from simple linear regression to more complex methods like time series analysis or panel data analysis.

In Cristhiano's case, the focus was on understanding the impact of different FIU models on a country's economic wellbeing. This involved:

- Formulating a hypothesis about the relationship between FIU models and economic wellbeing
- Choosing the appropriate econometric model to test this hypothesis
- Estimating the model using the provided data
- Interpreting the results of the model

## Conclusion

By the end of this part, Cristhiano was equipped with the necessary skills to analyze the data I had collected and prepared. He was able to use Stata to conduct econometric analysis and interpret the results, providing valuable insights into the impact of different FIU models on a country's economic wellbeing. 

In the next part of this project, we will delve into the results of Cristhiano's analysis and discuss the implications of his findings.
