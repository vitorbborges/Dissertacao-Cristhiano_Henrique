# Dissertacao-Cristhiano_Henrique

This repository consists of the R code that was made to collect and concatenate economic data. [Cristhiano Henrique Eufrasio da Costa](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9252323905076913) hired me to build this pannel data structure that will be used in his Master's Degree Thesis.

The main subject of his analysis is the impact of Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) Models of Administration in the economic wellbeing of the country in which it operates. FIU's can be run in one of the folowing models:

- The **Judicial Model** is when an FIU is established within the judicial branch of government. In this model “disclosures” of suspicious financial activity are received by a country’s investigative agencies from its financial sector so the judiciary powers can react (e.g., seizing funds, freezing accounts, conducting interrogations, detaining people, conducting searches, etc.).

- The **Law Enforcement Model** implements anti-money laundering measures alongside existing law enforcement systems, supporting the efforts of multiple law enforcement or judicial authorities with concurrent, or sometimes competing, jurisdictional authority to investigate money laundering.

- The **Administrative Model** is a centralized, independent, administrative authority, that receives and processes financial sector information and transmits disclosures to judicial or law enforcement authorities for prosecution. It functions as a “buffer” between the financial and law enforcement communities.

- The **Hybrid Model** serves as a disclosure intermediary and a link to both judicial and law enforcement authorities. It combines elements of at least two FIU models.
